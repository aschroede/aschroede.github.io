## Reflection
1. What went well?
- I got several leads on housing places - that's good that you started early.
- Chatting with Tom Claasen was super useful - he understands what I want to do and gave me good direction. 

2. What could have gone better?
- While hunting for a place has gone well, it has cost me a day of work, this is not fair to me or Stian.
I'm going to seriously look into the legal rules around kicking someone out of a place. We had a deal, and while it is
not written in a contract for the 2 years, that was my understanding. So for them to pull out the rug is not fair.
3. What will you do differently next time?
